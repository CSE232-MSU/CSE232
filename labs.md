# Labs

The lab sessions are designed to be learning tools that complement the lectures, as well as collaborative experiences where students work with each other and the Teaching Assistant to complete the exercise. Students who are late to lab might not receive credit for that session. Attendance is based on a good faith effort, i.e., the TAs will decide if you have put in a sincere effort to participate actively, collaborate with others, and attempt to complete the exercise.

The lab assignments (on Coding Rooms) are released at 10am on Tuesdays and due at 10pm on Fridays. Only students wishing to earn lab credit by earning all available points on the assigment need complete the assignment, it isn't otherwise worth any points.
