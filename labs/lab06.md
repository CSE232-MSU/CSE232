# Lab - Styling and Debugging

The aim of this lab is to:

- Do a code review to learn the Google Code style rules

- Learn to debug your C++ programs using `gdb` (the GNU Project Debugger). The purpose of a debugger is to allow you to see what is going on inside your C++ program while it runs. In addition, you can use `gdb` to see what your program was doing at the moment it crashed.

## Code Review

Although the compiler can often compile very ugly source code, the primary reader of your code won't be computers, but other humans (including yourself). And in much the same way that well-formatted essays are better at conveying information, well-formed code is easier to understand and debug. However, what does well-formed mean?

### Conventions

Although there are a few different conventions for what exactly defines well-formed code, the important thing is to be consistent. For this assignment, we will be evaluating your homework solution with respect to theÂ [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). The point of this part of the lab is to evaluate (and improve) code by using a consistent style. 

**Warning**: The code we have shown in videos and examples may not always conform to Google's standards.

### Rules

#### Naming

- [General Naming Rules](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#General_Naming_Rules)
- [Variable Names](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Variable_Names)
- [Function Names](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Function_Names)

#### Comments

- [Comments](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Comments)
- [Function Comments](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Function_Comments)
- [Implementation Comments](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Implementation_Comments)

#### Formatting

- [Line Length](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Line_Length)
- [Spaces vs. Tabs](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Spaces_vs._Tabs)
- [Function Calls](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Function_Calls)
- [Horizontal Whitespace](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Horizontal_Whitespace)

#### Functions

- [Parameter Ordering](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Function_Parameter_Ordering)
- [Write Short Functions](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Write_Short_Functions)
- [Reference Arguments](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Reference_Arguments)
- [Horizontal Whitespace](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Horizontal_Whitespace)

Use common sense, and **be consistent**.

If you are editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and determine its style. If there are spaces around `if` clauses, you should add them, too. If there are comments with little boxes of stars around them, make your comments have little boxes of stars around them, too.

The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so people can concentrate on what you are saying, rather than on how you are saying it. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary. But, local style is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically different from the existing code around it, the discontinuity throws readers out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Try to avoid this.

Okay, enough writing about writing code; the code itself is much more interesting. Have fun!

## Debugging with `gdb`

Here are some of the useful actions that `gdb` can perform:

- Start your program and step through it line by line
- Make your program stop on specified conditions
- Show the values of variables used by your program
- Examine the contents of any frame on the call stack
- Set breakpoints that will stop your program when it reaches a certain point. Then you can step through part of the execution using `step` and `next`, and type `continue` to resume regular execution.

[Download the code contained within this .zip file here.](../assets/downloads/lab_gdb.zip)

## Setting up `gdb`

Before we start using `gdb`, we need to activate a GDB init file. It does two things: firstly, it allows us to print C++ Standard Library containers and data members from within `gdb`, and secondly, it allows us to debug our programs while treating the C++ constructs as the "bottom level"; in other words, when we debug a piece of a program that includes a vector, we don't want the debugger to go all the way into the code that defines the vector.

The GDB init file should be contained within the .zip file you just downloaded from the above link.

Save the GDB init file to your home directory. Once saved, please rename the file to ".gdbinit". Note that the dot prefix makes the file hidden, so once you rename it, it will not be visible in the graphical file manager.

## Getting Started with `gdb`

C/C++ programs compiled with the GNU compiler and the `-g` flag can be debugged using GNU's debugger (actually, you can use `gdb` on code that is not compiled with the `-g` flag, but, unless you like trying to figure out how assembly code sequences map to your source code, I wouldn't recommend doing so).

First, you'll want to compile your code using this flag:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -g -Wall myprog.cpp
```

Then, to start `gdb`, invoke it on the executable file:

```bash
gdb a.out
```

If your program terminates with an error, then the operating system will often dump a core file that contains information about the state of the program when it crashed. `gdb` can be used to examine the contents of a core file:

```bash
gdb core a.out
```

One good way to get started when you are trying to track down a bug, is to set breakpoints at the start of every function. In this way, you'll be able to determine which function has the problem, then you can restart the program and step through the offending function line-by-line until you find the exact location of the bug within that function.

## Common `gdb` Commands

Words surrounded by angled-brackets (like `<this>`) represent parameters to the command, for which you'd supply some argument based on what the command expects.

___

- `help` - List classes of all `gdb` commands
    - `help <topic>` - Shows help available for topic or command
- `bt` - Shows stack; the sequence of function calls executed so far (good for pinpointing location of a program crash)
- `up` - Move up the stack
- `down` - Move down the stack
- `run` - Runs program from the beginning
- `break`
    - `break <line>` - Sets breakpoint at line number `<line>`
    - `break <func-name>` - Sets breakpoint at beginning of function `<func-name>`
    - `break main` - Sets breakpoint at beginning of program
- `continue` - Continues execution until next breakpoint
- `condition <bp-num> <exp>` - Sets breakpoint number `<bp-num>` to break only if
conditional expression, `<exp>`, is true
- `info break` - Shows current breakpoints
- `clear`
    - `clear <line>` - Clears breakpoint at line number `<line>`
    - `clear <func-name>` - Clears breakpoint at beginning of function `<func-name>`
- `delete` - Deletes all breakpoints
    - `delete <bp-num>` - Deletes breakpoint number `<bp-num>`
- `step` - Executes next line of program (steps into functions)
    - `step <count>` - Executes next `<count>` lines of program
- `next` - Executes next line of program (does not step into functions)
    - `next <count>` - Executes next `<count>` lines of program
- `until <line>` - Executes program until line number `<line>`
- `list` - Lists next few lines of program
    - `list <line>` - Lists lines around line number `<line>` of program
    - `list <start> <end>` - Lists line numbers `<start>` through `<end>`
    - `list <func-name>` - Lists lines at beginning of function `<func-name>`
- `print <exp>` - Displays the value of expression `<exp>`
- `quit` - Quit debugging

___

`gdb` also understands abbreviations of commands, so you can just type up to 
the unique part of a command name ("`cont`" for "`continue`", or "`p`" for "`print`")

## `info` Commands

`gdb` has a large set of `info X` commands for displaying information about particular runtime/debugger states. Here is how to list all the info commands in `help`, and a description of what a few of the info commands do:

```
(gdb) help status           # lists a bunch of info X commands

(gdb) info frame            # lists information about the current stack frame
(gdb) info locals           # lists local variable values of current stack frame
(gdb) info args             # lists argument values of current stack frame
(gdb) info registers        # lists register values
(gdb) info breakpoints      # lists status of all breakpoints
```

## Sample `gdb` Sessions

Below is the output from two runs of `gdb` on badString.cpp. You will follow along by entering the commands on your own computer. Be sure you understand each step, and ask your TA if you don't understand why something is being done.

Before debugging, run the a.out executable to see what happens.

(Comments are denoted by a `#` symbol, and are not part of the actual execution)

```
$ g++ -std=c++20 -g -Wall badString.cpp     # compile program with -g flag

$ gdb a.out                                 # invoke gdb with the executable

â­ So, what's the problem here? We executed Line 15 above, but, `ch` has a strange character in it. Describe the problem to your TA.

```

â­ So, what's the problem now? Describe what happened to your TA.

Read the `fn2()` code and fix it to run as it should. Make a new version called `fn2_fixed()`.

The following is a debugging session for `fn1()`. I'm not explaining any of it, just showing some stuff. Notice that I set a breakpoint I wanted to change, and searched the docs to find the command to do that (`clear`).

Also, the lines numbers are now off because you have a `fn2_fixed()` in the code to get it to run.

LOCATION may be a line number, function name, or "*" and an address.
If a line number is specified, break at start of code for that line.
If a function is specified, break at start of code for that function.
If an address is specified, break at that exact address.
With no LOCATION, uses current execution address of the selected

THREADNUM is the number from "info threads".
CONDITION is a boolean expression.

Multiple breakpoints at one place are permitted, and useful if t---Type <return> to continue, or q <return> to quit---

conditions are different.

Do "help breakpoints" for info on other commands dealing with breakpoints.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

`gdb` supports command line completion; by typing in a prefix, you can hit TAB and `gdb` will try to complete the command line for you.

Also, you can just give the unique prefix of a command and `gdb` will execute it. For example, rather than entering the command, `print x`, you can enter `p x` to print out the value of `x`.

The up and down arrow keys can be used to scroll through previous command lines, so you do not need to re-type them each time.

If you hit RETURN at the `gdb` prompt, `gdb` will execute the most recent command again. This is particularly useful if you are stepping through the execution -- you don't have to type `next` each time you want to execute the `next` instruction -- you can type it one time, and then hit RETURN for as long as you'd like.


## Honors Material - More Advanced Debugging

Debuggers are a critical component of producing clean, bug-free code.  But there are many other useful debugging (or bug-prevention) techniques as well.  These include [asserts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/assert) (to ensure that the data you are working with is the data that you think you are working with), [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) (to test individual functions or modules in your code), [integration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing) (to make sure code modules work together), [regression testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing) (to make sure you don't unintentionally change how your code works), [memory sanitizers](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/05/05/memory-error-checking-in-c-and-c-comparing-sanitizers-and-valgrind) (to double check if you are mis-using memory), verbose printing (to make sure code flows how you expect it to), and many others.

In this lab, you will experiment with verbose printing and unit testing.

### Background

Unit testing is a simple, yet powerful debugging technique.  In fact, unit tests are how we auto-grade code that students turn in on Coding Rooms -- we try to cover as many situations as possible to ensure that you turn in fully functional code.  But unit tests are for more than just classrooms.  You should be using them in all of your own coding projects, especially ones that get large or where you're working with other people.  They will initially identify problems as you first build the code, and then alert you if any later changes break functionality.

The key idea of a unit test is that you take a function (or other module) intended to perform a task on generic input.  You then run that function with a wide range of inputs (including any edge cases you can think of) to make sure that it always returns the expected result.  For example, if you were writing a `sort()` function that takes a collection of integers and puts them in order, your first unit test would probably be a jumbled set of integer values.  But then you would perform a whole series of other tests: Does it still work with negative numbers?  Does it work if a number is repeated?  Does it work if the input values are already sorted?  And so on.

A good set of unit tests will cover many different possibilities.

How do you write one?  If you wanted to perform tests on doubles, you might write:

```c++
bool TestResult(double result, double expected, const std::string error_message) {
  if (result != expected) {
    std::cerr << error_message << std::endl
              << "Result: " << result << std::endl
              << "Expected: " << expected << std::endl;
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

Once you learn more about templated functions, you'll be able to make this unit test much more generic.

Now let's build a function.

```c++
bool IsPrime(size_t value) {
  return value % 2 == 1;  // Meh, close enough.
}
```

And then let's build some tests!

```c++
// Test a nice, simple prime number.
TestResult(IsPrime(7), true, "Failed to identify 7 as prime.");
// Test a nice, simple composite number.
TestResult(IsPrime(10), false, "Failed to identify 10 as NOT prime.");
```

If we compile and run these tests, our function will pass!  Are we done?  No.  We need to try some edge cases.  Let's start with the lowest positive values.


```c++
// Test the only positive integer that is neither prime nor composite.
TestResult(IsPrime(1), false, "Failed to identify 1 as NOT prime.");
// Test the only even prime number.
TestResult(IsPrime(2), true, "Failed to identify 2 as prime.");
```

Now we'll get some actual results!  If we run out unit tests we'll see:

```
Failed to identify 1 as NOT prime.
Result: 1
Expected: 0
Failed to identify 2 as prime.
Result: 0
Expected: 1
```

Okay... let's fix the function, but if we're still being lazy and think maybe it's just small values that are different, we might write:

```c++
bool IsPrime(size_t value) {
  if (value <= 2) return value % 2 == 0; // Fix for low values?
  return value % 2 == 1;  // Meh, close enough.
}
```

Obviously this function is still wrong.  To discover that, we need to write many more unit tests, covering lots of options.

```
// Test a perfect square that's odd... they're tricky.
TestResult(IsPrime(9), false, "Failed to identify 9 as NOT prime.");
// Lets test a bigger number.
TestResult(IsPrime(10101), false, "Failed to identify 10,101 as NOT prime.");
// And test a big prime.
TestResult(IsPrime(17377), true, "Failed to identify 17,377 as prime.");
// And so on...
```

Ideally we want to have a wide range of tests in order to catch any likely problems in our code.  And if we do later discover a problem?  Add a test for it so that it never happens again!

The testing system described above is fairly simple.  A more sophisticated one would tally the number of errors, give us more information about them, and run automatically when we made changes to our code.  Later in the semester we'll talk more about building your on testing systems.

### Assignment

I am going to write a function with the signature:
```c++
int IsSecurePassword(const std::string password);
```

This function should take in the password you give it and score it based on the number of security criteria that it passes:
* It is at least 10 characters long
* It has at least one lowercase English letter
* It has at least one uppercase English letter
* It has at least one digit
* It has at least one special character from the set `!@#$%^&*()`
* It meets ALL of the previous four criteria in at least two different ways (i.e, two different lower letters AND two different upper letters AND two different digits AND two different special characters)

The score starts at zero and each bullet point it hits gives a +1, for a maximum score of 6.

I'll probably mess up a few times in trying to write this function, so for this assignment you will go and write the unit tests for me.

Create a version of the `TestResult()` function given above, but that takes an integer value for `result` and `expected`.  Then create a series of tests to make sure my `IsSecurePassword()` function works correctly.

In your code you should `#include "password.hpp"` which will have my version of `IsSecurePassword()` in it.  In your main function, you should run a series of tests.  If my function passes all of the tests, you should return 0 from `main()` (which means that there were no errors).  If my function fails any of your tests, you should return 1 from `main()` to indicate that there were errors.  Your program may have any outputs you like -- the grading system will only look at the value returned from main.

You need to put together a set of tests that find problems in all of my bad implementations of `IsSecurePassword()`, but also successfully identifies the one good version.

### Trivia

Today's triva will just tell you about a nice, simple debugging technique that you might want to try.

Verbose printing is just what it sounds like -- putting print statements all over your code so that you can track what's going on.  The problem, however, is that you don't want to have all of the random statements print when you are trying to run your code for real, but you do want them to print again when if you discover another problem and need to debug some more.

A simple trick is to put at the top of your code:
```c++
static constexpr bool verbose = true;
```

And then if you wanted to print the value of a variable `my_var`, you would write:

```c++
if constexpr (verbose) {
  std::cout << "my_var = " << my_var << std::endl;
}
```

The `if constexpr` statement means that what follows should be ignored (as if it weren't even in the code) if it evaluates to false.  It's quite handy, and allows for debugging code that completely goes away when you're not using it.

This techniques will work in most circumstances, but we can do even better.  Often we'll want to be able to control verbosity at compile time.  To do this, we can play with defines, like we did for Lab 04 (remember START_VALUE and END_VALUE?)

To do this, instead of simply declaring the `verbose` variable in your code, you can have:

```c++
#ifdef VERBOSE
static constexpr bool verbose = true;
#else
static constexpr bool verbose = false;
#endif
```

Then if we add `-DVERBOSE` to our compilation options, the verbose flag will be set, otherwise it will be turned off.
