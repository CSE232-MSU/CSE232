# Exam Policies

This course has 4 exams (3 multiple choice exams and 1 coding lab practical). Each exam is 90 minutes in duration (from timer start to timer end). ID checks will be performed, so please bring your student ID (or some other form of photo ID).

## Content

All exams are comprehensive. This includes material from lectures, labs, and homework. Each exam will cover material up to and including the week prior (e.g. Exam 1 will cover Weeks 00-04).

## Preparation

One week prior to each exam, a sample version will be released with questions broadly similar to the actual exam. The best way to prepare is to solve the sample exam, on your own, with the material you intend to bring to the actual exam. If you can't solve a question, come to help room, or ask on Piazza. We recommend that only after solving the sample exam, should you look at the solutions.

## Cheatsheets and Exam Aids

The exam is open book, meaning that you can bring whatever material you want, so long as it's not electronic. Printouts of reference material, textbooks, notes, the sample exam and key, etc. are all fine to bring.

I recommend bringing reference material on the topics that are hard to remember. For the final exam, you might consider the useful functions in the STL algorithm library and the many data structures (`std::vector`, `std::string`, `std::map`, `std::set`, etc.).


## Multiple Choice Exam Details

The exam location and time(s) will be announced on Piazza. The exams are conducted with bubble sheets, so be sure to bring a pencil and eraser. No electronics are allowed, so please leave smart watches, headphones, and similar wearables in your bag. The time remaining will be announced verbally and written on the board.

## Lab Practical Exam Details

In the last week of lab, you will be given an in-class Codio assignment in lieu of the regular lab. Please bring your computer (recommended fully charged as there are limited outlets) to the lab you are enrolled in. The exam's Codio page is the only application that you're allowed to have open (no IDEs). You are welcome to use any non-electronic resource during the exam. This includes textbooks, printed lecture slides, notes, example solutions to homework (including instructor solutions), and birthday cards. You may **not** use any online reference material or any other electronic resource.

### Section 730 Lab Practical

Those of you in Section 730 don't have an in-person lab to attend. Instead, you must attend one of the Zoom synchronous labs. 
You'll need to use the Zoom app on a separate device with a camera (likely a phone or tablet) that can show your workspace and computer screen. We strongly recommend plugging the device in as a disconnect caused by low battery may void your exam. You will obviously need a computer from which to take the exam, which will be a Codio assignment.

Please ensure that your screen, workspace and profile are visible by the Zoom device throughout the exam. Example:

## Past Exams

[All of the past in-person exams can be found here](https://cse.msu.edu/~cse232/Exam_Content/). Though, content on old exams won't necessarily be relevant to this semester's exams, as the course has evolved over time.

These old exams were also given as traditional paper exams. -->
