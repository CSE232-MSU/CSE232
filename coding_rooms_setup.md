# Coding Rooms Setup

Coding Rooms is the grading platform that we use in CSE 232 to submit work, grade your assignments and show examples. It is a required part of the class. And although I wish it was free, it costs $15. Please note that if your payment isn't processed (which can take up to 5 days) by the Add/Drop deadline, you will not be able to view or submit assignments. This will likely result in you failing those assignments, so please don't delay.
