# Updates to the course in future semesters

## Materials

* Update to new edition of C++ Primer as soon as it is out.
* Provide better links to existing tutorials and videos for students who want to learn the material from a different perspective.
* https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus/modules/learn-cpp-hello-world/cheatsheet

## TAs
* Have students review their TAs halfway through the semester?  This will allow us to identify any TA issues that we might be otherwise missing.  We would have specific questions like
    * Does the TA provide a helpful introduction at the beginning of each laboratory session.
    * Does the TA effectively answer questions during the laboratory?
* At least one instructor should sit in on each lab session at least once during the semester.
* We should provide the TAs with more written materials for how to run each lab.  Both material-based topics to talk about at the beginning and reminders/updates about the course itself.

## C++ Labs

* For the honors portion of lab 4, we should require specific function names and use unit tests to ensure that the functions are correctly built as constexpr.
* Lab 9 should have the students do operator overloading -- it's not especially complicated.

## Shell Contents

* Talk about -i option for rm to limit accidental deletions?
* Lab 07, teach about shell aliases?

## C++ Contents

* Make material more consistent with the standard library.  For example, use size_t when natural for the STL things like std::string::npos to indicate when no position exists.
* Don't use `const &` in parameters for variables small enough to be copied in the same space.
* Move `constexpr` into regular course material?
* Use .hpp for header files, not .h
