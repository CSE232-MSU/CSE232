# Using C++ in VSCode - Linux

If you managed to get a Linux distribution installed onto a computer, you are most likely familiar with official documentation lingo and the terminal. So, this will be up for you to decide on what is best.

You'll just need three things: a C++ compiler (I recommend `g++`), a text editor (I recommend VSCode), and a debugger (I recommend `gdb`), though a debugger is optional if you want to do this course the hard way.

[I'll leave this here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-linux) for you to reference, if you choose to install VSCode.

Since you're a Linux user, you may also be interested in learning [Vim](https://vimhelp.org/) alongside this course's content. Vim is a terminal-based text editor with _a lot_ of keybindings to memorize. When mastered, though, writing code can be incredibly fast.
